# Advent of Code (AoC) solutions

Here is my solutions for the yearly _Advent of Code_ event.

## End goal

For me the whole "AoC" event is fun little way learn a new language/skill.
I'm not really interested (at the moment of writing) to go for points but it doesn't mean I won't aim to full stars!

What I want to accomplish with this repo is 2 things:
- embrace the spirit of Open-Source by sharing my humble solutions
- force myself to be as tidy as possible keeping a healthy public repo

## Structure of the repo

This repo is divided into subdirectories representing each attempt ad the challenge.
Every attempt will have the format `year-goal` indicating the refrence year for the event and the goal of the single attempt

Each attempt is divided into 25 further subdirectories representing the different challenges proposed each year, one a day!

This same `README.md` file will contain reference to each attempt with some overall details.

Each attempt will contain further `README.md`s for each attempt and single challenge detailing context, status of completion and more specific notes.

Summing up, the following will be the final structure of the repo.
```
